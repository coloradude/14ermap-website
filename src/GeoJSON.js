There's also a dry rock patch crossing the snow, if you decide to lose some elevation to take that instead. The snow was firm in the morning, and only a little slippery at midday. No other snow issues.Descending via saddle vs back over Castle: After Conundrum, myself and two hikers who joined me tried to decide whether to go back over Castle, or to go down the saddle route. We decided to go down the saddle. It is fairly steep, but doable. The way I went, stepping on/holding onto solid rocks buried in the hillside, I faced inward a few times. It's more dirt near the top, and more small loose rock near the bottom. If I had to do it again, I'd still probably go down that way, as it saved a lot of time and elevation gain vs going back over Castle Peak, even waiting 10-15 minutes as courtesy for the two climbers below me to clear the bottom. If you're comfortable &quot;climbing mountains,&quot; the saddle is fine. But as a fellow hiker said, I wouldn't want to take my mom down that route. It was dry.. no snow or water issues."

We hiked from there maybe about 1.5 miles  to the trailhead and the rest of the road looked fine beyond the one rough spot. When you come to the fork in the road make sure to stay right. You'll see a small lot with cars and know you're in the right place after about 15 minutes of walking from the fork. The hike itself was beautiful and not too busy, we started from the trailhead at 7:45, reached the peak at 10:30 and were back down to the base at 12:45.

You can avoid some of the snow by carefully stepping on rocks, but in other places it is more packed down and a bit slick. It CAN be done without traction.. We made it down without microspikes.. We made it okay, but were very slow and careful. I would recommend taking yaktrax or microspikes though. I was thinking about putting them on, but was almost past the snowy area at that time.

It's not deep, or that treacherous, but bring your microspikes just in case. Otherwise, from the start, it's a beautiful walk through the forest. At the point where you would turn left to Crater Lake, you'll turn right to head towards North Maroon. There is a junction at 10,800 marked by a cairn that will lead you down to the creek. From there, the real hiking begins. Hike up a series of boulder steps that turns into talus rock. Once around 11,500 feet, cross the boulder field to the upper break in the cliff side. The gullies are not typical gullies that I've been in. There isn't much scree or loose rock, and there's a fairly good trail leading the whole way in both &quot;gullies&quot;. Once at the notch at 13,200 feet, you'll need to use more body strength to pull yourself up higher and higher, for the rest of the way. When you get to the chimney, you can go further to the left and climb up some other rocks to avoid the chimney. You'll cross over two tall square shaped rocks. This whole area is kind of a blur honestly. It was exhausting. You will go through some snow, so have your microspikes."

We expected it to be mainly a dusting but took microspikes and an axe just in case, and it's good we did. The snow was surprisingly crusty and the spikes were very helpful (though not required; other people were climbing without them). It's not very solid though, and it often cracks when you step on it. Given the snow, we were not certain about doing the class 3 bypass around the chimney, though the chimney turned out to be doable but rather difficult. Many of the holds were covered in snow/ice, including the good handhold that many people use to pull up on the final ledge. We were unable to find that hold in the ice and had to wedge ourselves between the rocks and shimmy further up until we could step onto the ledge. We did try to clear off the snow from the ledge so maybe it will melt out over the next few days."

The steepest part is the final ascent up Shavano, so if you are discouraged from climbing Tabeguache after you summit Shav, think again. Once you reach the saddle, the ascent up Tab takes only about 15 minutes and the rocks aren't the stairmasters that you find on Shav. It's about 30-45 minutes from the top of Shav to the top of Tab. Go for it! The ascent back up Shav is a little long but gradual, and then you are home free. Just be safe descending steep Shav."

You walk across logs to get to the other side, but are met with some overturned tree limbs. Just know that's the right way to go. The only downside this morning was that the wind was quite severe on the switchbacks near the top as well as at the summit. We made a short attempt to go across the ridge to Oxford but the rocks were loose and the wind made me feel as though it was going to knock me down. People on the way down said it usually calms down after the sun has been up for a bit so may need to try that again a bit later in the morning next summer :)"

No snow and no wet spots. The trial is fairly well marked (watch for that first trail junction) and you shouldn't worry about getting lost. Coming down, the dirt path on the last large hill before the forest is very slippery because of the pebbles on the hard dirt. I slipped and fell 5 times!"

My plan was to leave earlier than I normally would for a class 2 peak with a good weather forecast in order to beat the 'weekend riff-raff' and have some solitude. Started hiking from the TH at 2am, ascended the North Ridge route in full moonlight with no use for my headlamp, I was ALONE (I know on Holy Cross on a Saturday!) on the summit for the sunrise 5:45-6:15, descended the Halo Ridge which took about 3 hours taking short breaks on each summit. The only people I saw all day were a handful of groups making their way up the Halo Ridge (pretty late in the day I might add). Only notes on route conditions would be watch out for loose talus! Some large blocks that appear to be stable are actually not, and with the amount of talus hopping this full loop route involves it would be easy to get complacent and lose focus and get hurt."

Typical pot holes and small rocks, but my sedan was able to make it all the way to the trailhead with ease.*Trail Condition: Navajo Trailhead: Muddy throughout, but because of the rain mostly. It should dry up within the next couple days. Easy to follow.  Wilson:98% snow free, but avoidable. Dry. The worst loose rock I have experienced (worse than Maroon). The cairns past 13,300 are invisible, so print off pictures from 14ers.com. They were very helpful and helped me stay right on track. Wilson Peak: Nice and easy from 12,300 in Navajo Basin to 13,000 saddle. From here, the 14ers.com directions are vague at best. Read below for more direction. The rocks were loose, but not as bad as Mt. Wilson."

An SUV without 4WD, might be able to make it. There's plenty of parking spots right at the start of #277 for all other vehicles.Trail Condition: You'll be on a road covered with river rocks for 90% of the time. Luckily the gorgeous autumn leaves made it entertaining and I didn't mind the road at all. You can avoid all water and the peak is snow free. However, once again, it was cold and windy! Once you leave the road, the ridge is easy to follow. Once you reach the end of the ridge, expect small shale the whole way up which makes for a little annoyance as you have to really watch your step to avoid tripping or twisting an ankle.***Also, I have extra notes on my blog post how you can avoid some of the switchbacks on the way up/down to shorten the hike by a couple miles."

The road was dry and even with some long stretches of rough, loose rock.  This makes the descent quite challenging so watch your footing! There is little to admire and, thankfully, little traffic to deal with during the ascent.We finally reached the summit trail, at 13,800' - a short route across a ridge (some exposure and scrambling in places) and a quick ascent to the summit. The ridge was the highlight of the hike for us as we were quite disappointed by the bland and boring road hike we'd had up to this point. After the ridge, we angled to the right, picking up a gradually rising trail that took us to the summit. There are several cairns marking the route and the beautiful, clear weather made it easy to pick it out from the massive talus slope. There is also a direct ascent to the summit from the ridge for the impatient hikers or those with little time for the ascent."

Walking on the road wasn't a very exciting hike and we had to move out of the way of ATVs and cars while going up and down since it's a narrow road. Just before 13,100', we took a well-beaten path to the left of the road (if heading up) to walk up to the 13,100' point (kind of a small field). This was shorter mileage-wise than following the road as it wrapped around this point. At this point/field, make sure to get on the right road that continues to Antero rather than the 13er (Mt. White) in the distance - see 14er's photo #15 for this route to make sure you stay on the right road. We stayed on the road all the way to 13,800' (option 2 of the two options from 13,100').At 13,800' (the last place cars can drive to), there's a small ridge to get to the final ascent. The route on the ridge was easy to follow but very windy. The final ascent up Mt. Antero did not have a very easy to follow route - especially coming down and was also very windy. The summit, however, was not windy at all and offered great views of Princeton, Shavano, and Tabeguache. Coming down, we cut down a trail to cut some mileage off the hike and get down faster (clouds looked like they were moving in) and were able to cut off a few switchbacks on a well-beaten path. We saw another hiker avoid most of the switchbacks below 13,100' by cutting all the way down in a gully with a lot of rocks.Our trip took us about 6 hours round trip from the 10,850' creek crossing including stops and breaks and about 20 minutes at the summit. Driving the road from the 2WD trailhead (off 162) to the creek crossing took about 30 minutes up and a bit longer down. I posted road conditions on the TH section if you want to know about the Jeep Road 277."

First getting up the head wall was pretty tough. The trail is getting wider and wider because people are trying to find a way up with some solid footing. Its basically all gravel and loose dirt and nothing to really prevent you from slipping. Being so steep made this tough. As bad as going up was, going down was worse, basically I just skied down the mountain. Someone called it &quot;Texas Skiing&quot;. Either way it was pretty tough because it was very steep and very loose. The next part was the first false summit. On the Nat Geo Topo map the trail stops around this area. The reason is because there really is no defined trail up that first summit. You sort of make it up as you go. There are some cairns here and there and they help to a point but the main goal was to just get up and over so you can actually see the ridge leading to the real summit. The last thing is about the washed out road leading to the trail head. I stopped at this area and was prepared to hike up from there but then decided to take the Ford Explorer through it, and had no problem. Took it slow and at the correct angle. This cut off about 2 miles on the hike which I was thankful for because my legs were screaming from the steep hike. I took a couple pictures because I know some people have had questions in the past about this area. Overall this was an amazing hike. I only saw 2 groups going up when I left at 7:00. One group of 1 adult and three teen age boys turned around after they got up the head wall and saw what faced them ahead. The other two guys I passed up and met at the summit. On the way down I ran into 2 other groups. Very peaceful but hard hike. The drive up was amazing, fall colors right at their peak in most areas and past in some."

Other SUVs and crossovers will want to stop at the washed-out creek or earlier if you get uncomfortable.  I would not take a passenger car very far up the road to the trailhead.  We started from the trailhead proper @ 5:30 AM.  Lower sections of the route are marshy in areas, but nothing too bad with some rock hopping.  Otherwise, the route is in pretty good shape and well defined save for some areas on the ridge that are noted in the route guide.  Summited @ 10:00 AM and was down by 12:30 PM."

If you want it, contact me through my profile info here on 14ers.com. Perfect time to do this peak from SW ridge. No issues. In the marshy flats just above treeline there are a two 10-20 yard sections of ankle-deep mud. You can avoid it by carefully stepping on helper rocks, but be prepared with good footwear. As reported earlier for this route, the road is washed out about a mile from the TH. There appeared to be parking for about 6-10 vehicles at the wash-out point, and there was plenty of space left when we walked back around 1pm. There are a couple logs laid across the creek for an easy crossing by foot. If your car cannot make it past Winfield, you could also walk in from Winfield, which is 2 miles from the TH. The path from the road to the TH is a bit hard to spot in the dark, and the TH sign is nothing more than a piece of dilapidated plywood now. Go left at the plywood to begin your ascent."

Thus, no need for traction or an axe. There are a few gullies retaining snow on the route, but they can easily be bypassed, with the exception of a section at 14,000' (the bypass is less evident). I've added some annotated pictures which might make more sense than my words, but I'll do my best to describe it. En route to East La Plata, you ascend one final talus slope towards what Roach describes as a &quot;snow-filled gully&quot; at 14,000'. Once you reach the base of the gully, he suggests skirting to the left (SE), ascending to the left of the gully, and traversing to the right above the gully towards the ridge crest. As my pictures show, it is difficult to skirt left as there is a 5 ft. snow drift blocking the path. Instead, cross immediately underneath the snow gully and ascend up the right side of the gully, close to the ridge crest. You can keep it around class 3 if you take your time.      We topped out and descended the Northwest Ridge route. There is a 200m snow field around 13k' that we were able to glissade (albeit slowly, accumulating slush in our underpants). Other than that, nothing noteworthy except for several lengthy pennants of dirty toilet paper affixed to the grass significantly above timberline, immediately adjacent to the trail, fluttering in the breeze like little poop-smeared flags of surrender.

I did not know where the trail head was so my GPS took me to the over flow lot.  It was empty at 6:00.  It was still dark so I used my head lamp until about 6:40.  I took the short trail from the over flow lot and turned right to go up the road.  I was not sure where the next lot was but lucky for me I went the correct way and found the actual trail.  At 6:15 there was already 8 cars at the main trail head with all the actual parking spots taken.  The trail is well marked from the parking area.  About a hour into my hike I began to come upon the other hikers on the trail.  I hiked 13 14ers last summer and 5 this summer.  Quandary is listed as one of the easier hikes.  I think the reason for this is that the trail is a steady climb but not super steep.  You gain a lot of elevation, over 1000ft per mile but it is not steep.  Until you leave tree line the trail is mostly dirt with some rock.  Once you leave tree line it gets rocky for most of the trail.  There is one section near the false summit where the rocks get fairly big but other than this the rocks are not huge that you have to climb.  I would not consider this a good &quot;first climb&quot; mountain but overall it was a nice hike.  It took me about 3 hours to summit and 2 hours to descend.  I did hike with my dog, a border collie, and she did great.  We did not see any goats on our hike.  As usual, the view from the summit is spectacular and makes the hike more than worth it."

Arrived at the trailhead just after 6:00am, with concerns about bad weather in the forecast for late morning.  Cloudy but not stormy looking.  Trailhead was not crowded early on a Thursday.  By the time we cleared the trees we had much better light and conditions looked okay.  This was my daughter's first fourteener and they were a bit surprised at the grade and the overall size of the mountain.  First encountered the goats as we broke the trees, a mom and baby.  The mother seemed wary of us but not intimidating like I have heard several people describe previously.  In fact, on the shallower portion of the ridge, another goat ambled along in front of us for a long stretch, occasionally looking back as if guiding us up the mountain.  He eventually veered off after we reached the much steeper part of the ridge.  By the time we reached the steeper portion some light rain/sleet was falling and temps had dropped considerably.  We knew that what we could see from below was a false summit but it was still discouraging to see how much we still had left after reaching it.  We actually made very good time on the top portion and reached the top in just over three hours amidst light snow.  Our summit party soon grew to around fifteen climbers as many groups were just behind us all the way up.  Descent was tricky with the wet conditions making the talus very slick.  This was my first hike/climb using trekking poles and I would recommend them for the stability they provide on rocky sections."

I was surprised to find very few cars, and was able to park right near the trailhead. Started my solo climb up the mountain at 6:30am. It was a steep climb right from the start, with the sun starting to rise, it was a beautiful ascent through a wooded forest. As soon as the trail moved above tree line, it transitioned from soft dirt to lots of loose rock. The second half of the climb was all talus, which was a scramble at a times, leading you straight up to the summit. Sometimes it was hard to recognize where the trail actually was, but there were many cairns that helped direct you. Two mountain goats were intimidating hikers near the trail where the talus leveled out before the steep pitch. On the way down, there were more goats in the valley to the left.  I reached the summit just before 11am. The most difficult attribute of this 14er is the short mileage but steep elevation gain -- 3,450' in a short 3.33 miles! The weather was perfect - very little wind (approx 10MPH) and the temperature was 45 degrees at the summit. Got an early start because rain was forecasted in the afternoon. On the way down it sprinkled a little but thankfully no storms even though the clouds looked threatening in the distance. Was back to the trailhead by 2pm. The descent seemed almost as hard, especially on the knees and I was worried about rolling my ankles, but I was fine. This was my fifth Fourteener, and even though it's classified as an &quot;easy Fourteener&quot;, I would concur with the sign at the trailhead that read, &quot;There are no easy Fourteeners.&quot;"

Maxwell all the way to Culebra the ridges, peaks, and route were all snow free. Quite a bit of elevation lost from Lomo Liso to Miranda Peak.  Miranda Peak is where there's class 3 sections, but fairly negotiable if you take the time to study where to go.  Once upon Miranda Peak's ridge it's pretty straight forward to Culebra.  Staying ridge proper as much of the time as possible is the easiest way for route finding.  If you get away from the ridge... just do your best to get back to it.  Lots of loose rock and talus throughout the entire hike, mainly Miranda Peak through Culebra.  Lots of mileage and lots of vert.  Good luck!#6"

Most of what I read about climbing Culebra proved to be very accurate. The ranch personnel were at the gate well before 6 am and had us climbing with no wasted time. The road to 4 way was very steep, I learned to give vehicles in front of me plenty of room. The road above the 4 way was not any tougher but the parking area was down in a low spot, steep and full of rocks, would be very tough to get out of this lot without a decent 4 wheel drive. Coming back on the road to the ranch I was in 4 low and going slow.  Climbing: No snow on the route anywhere. There is a bit of a trail at the beginning that goes to the left side of the basin, we crossed back over the creek and climbed the grassy, less rocky slopes to the right and zig zagged to the very southern most part of the ridge. This route brought us to the ridge near the giant cairn, seemed to be a most direct and very reasonable direction. Once on the ridge, there was only one place to be, following the ridge to the peak. Nice to climb a 14er that had so few people climbing at once. Saw elk crossing the peak before sunrise and more marmots than usual. Most people climbing were on their last of close to last 14er, hmm. One of my favorite peaks, worth the 150 bucks."

Some groups managed without traction but micro spikes or trail crampons were helpful even with the hard snow early and the spikes and ice axes made for a much surer ascent.  Many of the cups/boot-tracks slope down the hill and were quite slick; so, the tendency was to slip out and down the hill.  The class 3 above the ramp is clear to both Eolus and N. Eolus.  As the snow softens later in the morning, but before it's soft enough to posthole, the hike back down the ramp can be iffy even with spikes.  My climbing partner's spikes slid on the softer covering snow and he ended up needing to do a self arrest; so, the axe was certainly a good thing to have at that instant."

The road is rough with typical pot holes and pointy rocks, and I had to park where the directions from 14ers.com suggested.*Trail Condition: The trail practically starts above treeline, so you don't have to worry about bears on the trail (unless  crazy bad luck). It's a very easy trail to navigate marked with cairns along the way. When you get near the lake, and the trail splits, take a left to continue up Handies. You'll see the switchbacks along the side of the mountain. The trail has a lot of scree, so make sure you have shoes with good grip."

A sedan or even a SUV or truck without 4WD will not make it far on the road after the Angel of Shavano Trailhead.Trail Condition: You will have to do a lot of trail finding on this route. The route is considered &quot;abandoned&quot; so it is very rugged and trails will start and then disappear often making it a difficult class 2 mountain. The trail from what I hear is also consistently very windy. Be prepared for that. When you reach the hill also known as Point 13,936 go straight up it and look for a cairn at the base (made by Anne and yours truly.) You'll weave straight up it. There are two more cairns along the way to look for to help you reach the top as easily as possible. Expect the entire ridge to be windy and jagged with rocks and barely there trails. On your return, make sure to watch for your turn back onto the long ridge leading back to Point 13,936. There is a misleading defined trail that got us off track, so I hope you avoid it."

Snow coverage is continuous top to bottom, with only minimal rock debris, mostly on the fan near the base. Remnants of the big cornice (now more of a vertical snow wall) still guard most of the top, but there is a reasonable exit (~50 degrees) on climber's right. We used crampons, an alpine axe, and a second tool, and found all to be very useful. Snow conditions were definitely on the firm side, with some places accepting only front points and pick placement, and others allowing for the occasional shaft plant and shallow (couple inches) step-kick (for reference, we were in the couloir from about 8:30-9:45). There were several deep runnels in which one could stem if desired for a little relief from the otherwise rather steep and sustained climb (&gt;40 degrees for the entire length of the couloir, and &gt;45 for a good bit of it as well). Other notes:-We saw numerous hikers without any snow gear. Their way to get past the lower headwall was to cross it as low as possible and get onto the talus slope between the two lobes of the snowfield. From that talus &quot;island&quot;, they then still had to cross a bit of snow near the top to get onto the standard (NE ridge) Castle trail. That crossing is short, tracked out, and not very steep, but if one were to slip on it in the firm morning snow, they'd be looking at a ~500 foot ride all the way back down to the base of the snowfield. Just FYI. -The snow slope below the C/C saddle was melted out about 150' below the ridge (see second photo). We didn't go this way, opting instead to just descend the standard trail after summitting Castle from Conundrum, but it looked loose and unpleasant. We did see a few people go both up and down that way throughout the day, and also some some good-sized rocks dislodged from the scree slope. Needless to say, folks without an ice axe did not go down this way, but went back over Castle instead. -Thanks to LiquidShadow and others for providing the info that encouraged us to attempt this route so late in the season! It was a great climb."

It's a great time of year to do Capitol! A couple pointers:- 4WD road to trailhead: We were in a low clearance 2WD sedan and made it to the trailhead. However, it is a gnarly road and we got a flat tire on the way up. I'd encourage drivers with similar vehicles to park at the horse trailer parking lot that is called out in the route description. If you are starting and ending your hike at popular times, you might be able to hitchhike between the two parking lots.- Hike in to Capitol Lake: Left the trailhead at 11:30 am and arrived at the lake at 3:00 pm. Get to the lake early on a weekend if you want a good tent site. There were plenty of sites still available when we arrived. By 6:00 pm, there were slim pickings.- Summit Push: We left Capitol Lake at 5:15 am, summited at 9:15 am, and were back to Capitol Lake by 1:15 pm.- Hike back to Trailhead: We left Capitol Lake at 2:30 pm and reached the trailhead at 5:15 pm. - Gear Recommendations: As others have noted, the following are no longer necessary: crampons, micro spikes, ice axes, and gaiters. Helmets are a must since there are many times when you find yourself climbing directly below another party in terrain with loose rock. Bear cans are required due to recent bear activity."

From there I took the traverse around to the NW Couloir on Crestone Peak. The lower section of the couloir is snow free as of 9/12/15 up through the first elbow. The upper Y of the couloir is still choked with snow and ice and made for tricky scrambling (no crampons/ice axe). I climbed the headwall to the climbers right to get around the rock hard snow/ice (low class 5) before scrambling back to the headwall that leads directly to the summit.Overall there is about 100-150ft of snow that needs to be bypassed, but it runs wall to wall right before the Y, so requires some tricky class 4 to low class 5 scrambling to get around.The Red Gully was completely clear of snow, easy travel. The traverse from Crestone Peak to Needle is all clear and well marked with cairns. The descent off Crestone Needle is also in good shape, just be careful with rockfall."

The trail was easy to follow until we hit the rocks - in that area we just followed what we thought was a good path and probably were off-trail slightly a lot of it. There were lots of people out and on the summit when we arrived around 10 am (we were moving slowly because I wasn't feeling great). As always, coming down was tough on the knees - especially in some of the loose rock areas and coming down the road was a bit challenging because of the loose gravel.

It's incredibly hilly, but despite 14ers.com advising only 4WD, I made it 2.5 miles up the road- taking 5 miles off my hike!*Trail Condition: The road is easy to navigate and the pictures easily show you when to turn off onto the trail. From here on, you need to watch where you're stepping with every step. The boulders at the beginning are fun in my opinion, but once you get past the easy boulder hopping, it gets much harder to follow the trail. There are trails EVERYWHERE! Due to rock movement, you might think you're on a trail, and then all of the sudden it'll disappear. Even some cairns are misleading. It can make it a heart pounding ascent fighting with loose scree. Just follow the directions the best you can, and slowly but surely, you'll get there."

Continued up road and found trail entrance on our right. Climb up steep trail from road and your on your way.  Trail is easy at first and then turns to very rocky conditions, lots of climbing and stepping over rocks for the majority of the climb.  To me it was a tough climb due to all the rock climbing. Trail is faint at times but you can see the summit throughout most of the climb. Wished I had cut off main trail for the ridge instead of staying on lower trail. Most people were taking high trail and I think it would have been easier.  Took us about 6 hours roundtrip but we took our time....so nice at summit we spent 30+ min."

The SW slopes were certainly steep, and the trek up was challenging. Nevertheless, it was a gorgeous day and the trail in generally good condition. The only parts of the trail which could be considered ambiguous were the sections through talus/scree, but cairns were generally well marked. On the final push to the summit (after the false 14,xxx summit), another hiker went slightly off the trail but I alerted him to the cairn he missed and he was able to scramble up a small hill to reach the main, more obvious trail which I was on. The winds at the top were surprisingly light, and there were few clouds in the sky. This trail overall was in fantastic condition, and the fall colors changing made the views of the valleys below spectacular. There were a good deal of other hikers on the trail as well."

There are two pretty rough spots but we made it through without scrapping the bottom.  I did notice that the parking area had only high clearance SUVs and trucks.  We camped across from the trail head.  There are at least 5 or more nice little camping spots up at the parking area.  There are many more spots down below the trail head on the way up.  We got up early and started hiking at 5:15 am.  The first mile of the 4 mile hike is very easy and only has an elevation gain of about 300 ft.  This means that the last 3 miles of the hike has about 3600 ft in elevation.  Once you hit the trail head junction of Halfmoon trail and Massive trail, turn right to take the Massive trail.  This is when you start climbing and do not stop climbing until you reach the summit.  There are 3 false summits.  The view from the top is definitely worth it and is spectacular.

With my Saturn SL2 (a sedan) I made it just .3 miles shy of the trailhead. It's hilly and there are numerous potholes, but driving carefully you can make it that far in a car.Trail Condition: The trail is fairly straightforward except for when you get to the meadow. Somehow I got lost in the meadow for a good 10-15 minutes. There are multiple trails in the meadow. If the trail isn't dirt and rocks, you're on the wrong one. You cannot see the summit from here. Walking in the meadow, the mountain is to your RIGHT, and the trail leads up and across, not down. There is a sign that says either Half Moon Creek and continuing straight, or turning right and going up on Massive trailhead- this is the one you want to take. Once you're past this, the trail is straightforward."

We saw one Jeep make it all the way to Como Lake- which was mind boggling.*Trail Condition: 8,000 to Como Lake: You'll be on the road the entire time. The road mixes between dirt areas where it's easier to walk, but mostly river rock and boulders. Eyes on the ground mostly to watch your step. Como Lake to Ellingwood Point: You're still going to be on a road until 12,000 ft. elevation. Easy slow gain to this point. Trail is in great condition and easy to follow with the cairns. We took the higher route on Ellingwood (class 3) and it's more than fine- nothing too scary at all (coming from a person who has a slight fear of heights). Ellingwood Point to Blanca Peak: Trail at the divide between the two and on to Blanca is a difficult class two. You'll have to pull yourself up in some areas. Otherwise, just weave your way up watching for cairns until the summit. Some loose rock, but not bad."

FS regulation is no group larger than 14. And what would a rope do there is no where to put any pro on a scree slope. And what were you doing in the LEFT side of the couloir? The route description specifically says stay RIGHT when it forks near the top, the left side is much sketchier. To anyone looking to just hit Ellingwood and avoid Lake Como, this is a great route. The C2 couloir is loose, I was glad I was the only one in it this morning, but with careful foot placement and sticking on the side where there is larger solid rocks it is definitely not as bad as the last guy makes it sound (I avoided the eroded slippery social trails in the center), definitely no rope or class 4 moves required.

Several of the group members and I had been reading trip reports for this trail to make sure we knew what we were getting into. None of the reports accurately describe the C2 Coulier, which is the recommended coulier for traversing to the North Ridge of Ellingwood.This report is particularly for non-Colorado 14er enthusiasts who depend on this site and trip reports to plan their trip. The C2 Coulier had too much loose rock and scree to be safe without additional climbing gear such as helmets and rope. We had neither and managed to get 13 of our 15 men to the ridge, but not without injury and significant stress. If the coulier had consistent solid rock on which to climb, this would live up to the Class 3 designation. However, with the unstable rock and scree on a steep 60 degree slope, this coulier should be ranked at a difficult class 3 or easy class 4 route. Additionally, there are no well-cairned routes along the north ridge for Ellingwood. Five of our men managed their way to just below summit, but had to turn back due to weather developing in the east. Three of us, including myself, made it to the north ridge where we could see the storm clouds developing to the east and also turned back. Our primary concern was being stuck on C2 Coulier in rain. That would have made decent nearly impossible and left us exposed well above treeline. Fortunately, the weather held and we all made it down to safety before the storm finally developed mid-afternoon. I would not recommend this route to moderate or even experienced climbers without gear and preparation for Class 4 climbing up C2."

I saw several people going far to the right of the rock rib up against a little wall; be careful that way, there's water along that wall hidden under the grass in the upper reaches and it can make for a slick and dangerous climb. Otherwise, incredible day with hardly a breath of wind or a cloud in the sky.For anyone interested in Kit Carson, I originally intended to climb both, but decided I'd had my fill of dropoffs with Challenger. However, the way is completely clear with only a little snow still clinging along Kirk's, nothing on the avenue. I saw at least two people walking around at the summit and heard a few more talking about making the attempt. Be safe out there."

It was miserable fending them off and they do not relent until about 13,500'. Up to the headwall is completely clear of snow, although all the melt is filling parts of the trail with water, so be prepared to get a little wet. That said, I was fine with water-resistant boots, and the big crossings aren't hard as long as you're careful walking along logs.I hit Kirk's Couloir right about sunrise, hoping to make it to the top and then decide whether to try for Kit Carson or just do Challenger. Even before the sun hit the snow the slope was pretty soft, and it only got worse as the day progressed. Even with ice axe and crampons I felt the slope was pretty treacherous, and I recommend not using this route unless you really want to crack your skull open. I finally aborted about 3/4 of the way up, and the ride down was a little heart-pounding. I heard multiple people on the trail say that the north route to Challenger is clear and does not require additional traction beyond a decent pair of boots. I've also heard that Kit Carson is just as loose as Kirk's Couloir, and I wouldn't attempt it until the snow is gone and the summer trail is exposed. Probably another two weeks at the most.I will post some pictures once they are processed."

If you are tight on a budget like myself, park in the residential area not far from the train station for free- just be sure to look for parking signs. Train costs $100!! You can also take the train from Silverton- which I recommend. If you call them, you can get a discount- tell them you're being dropped off at Needleton either way.*Trail Condition: Needleton Stop to Chicago Basin (6 mi.): Trail is very well marked and an easy incliine. The best part of the hike is about 3 miles in (lots of waterfalls). Eolus: Cross the stream near Twin Lakes. It's steep, but there are steps in the start, but it then turns to a lot of scree. After the &quot;Cat Walk&quot; DO NOT continue up the ridge line. It's high exposure, and a lot of class 4 moves. Instead, keep an eye out for cairns that follow switchbacks right below the summit. It's much safer."

Note: the gate at the &quot;welcome station&quot; was coned off, implying the parking was fun, which it probably way at 5PM, but it is worthwhile to check it out for yourself. Things to know:Bear Canisters: Have one. The rangers are pretty serious about it and it would suck to get turned around if you didn't have one. THE FIRST ROCK CAIRN (photo 5):  which takes you off the main trail to carter lake. It will take you up into the woods, parallel the main trail and return back to the main trail, which is also designated with a large cairn. Along that horseshoe there is a trail that branches off which is not hard to miss (i did). Luckily i went back and found my way. After the Talus field (photos 10 and 11): There's a couple routes that look like the one in the picture from a far. When you get closer you can see the foot  trail at the bottom taking you up the best way. Best advice for the top (3rd/4th class section): Follow the Cairns!!! If you ever feel like you haven't seen one for a while, you're probably not taking the easiest path."

The turn off for Pyramid Peak is the first marked trail by a very large cairn. Once on that trail, it is marked on and off with a very rocky trail that could twist your ankle. Once your in the amphitheater, it only gets worse. My ankles were absolutely shot after this hike having to balance so much on jagged, rarely flat rocks. Don't pay attention to the cairns, as much as just make your way to the steep gully. YOU CAN GO UP EITHER TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT!  The trail is more defined on the left in my opinion. The gully is very steep with lots of dirt to make you slip. Once at the top of the saddle, follow the trail and once you get to 13,150-13,200, go to the LEFT around the backside of the mountain. The trail is more defined, easier, and you'll avoid climbing in the dangerous snow (you should be able to avoid it by 99%). Keep your eyes out for the cairns and make sure you're wrapping towards the backside of the mountain as you summit. The rock is solid, but there is a lot of free smaller rocks sitting on them that could cause you to slip.Minor detail, but expect to pay for entrance into the park."

We saw one Jeep make it all the way to Como Lake- which was mind boggling.*Trail Condition: 8,000 to Como Lake: You'll be on the road the entire time. The road mixes between dirt areas where it's easier to walk, but mostly river rock and boulders. Eyes on the ground mostly to watch your step. Como Lake to Ellingwood Point: You're still going to be on a road until 12,000 ft. elevation. Easy slow gain to this point. Trail is in great condition and easy to follow with the cairns. We took the higher route on Ellingwood (class 3) and it's more than fine- nothing too scary at all (coming from a person who has a slight fear of heights). Ellingwood Point to Blanca Peak: Trail at the divide between the two and on to Blanca is a difficult class two. You'll have to pull yourself up in some areas. Otherwise, just weave your way up watching for cairns until the summit. Some loose rock, but not bad."

                            "report" : "Hi! My name is Kristina! This is my 51st fourteener summit this summer/season. My goal is to climb all 54 (with the exception of Culebra. Instead I did North Maroon). You can read more about this hike and others at Sunshineof1985.com. Enjoy!Route: North FaceDistance to Trailhead from Parking Lot:14 miles round tripDistance to Mount Lindsey from Trailhead: 8.66 miles round tripTotal Distance: 22.66 miles round tripTotal Elevation Gain from Parking Lot: 5,150 ft.Elevation Gain from Trailhead: 3,500 ft.Start Time: 8:35amEnd Time: 6:45pmTime to get to Trailhead from Parking Lot: 2 hours and 15 minutes with bikeTime to get to Summit from Trailhead: 3 hours and 30 minutesTime to get back to Trailhead from Summit: 3 hours and 20 minutes (stopped and picked up a lot of rocks)Time to get back to Parking Lot from Trailhead: 1 hour and 5 minutes with bikeOverall Pace: 2.2 miles per hour with bike and stopping to pick up rocksGEAR (to bring):Bike (optional), bear spray, GPS, extra socks, phone, SPOT Satellite Tracker, Map, Topo Map from 14ers.com, hiking boots with 2 pairs of socks on, long-sleeve, wind-guard/raincoat, light weight puffy coat, warm hat, lightweight gloves, day pack with water sack (64 oz), snacks.Road Condition: For one thing, don't follow the GPS if you're coming from the south. It tried to lead me an inaccessible way and for those of you that don't know, the road 580, to the trailhead is closed!! You'll have to park by the sign that states it's 5.3 miles to Upper Huerfano. From there it's 1.6 miles to the closed gate (which they won't let you park by). It's a total of 7 miles from the parking lot to get to the trailhead now because of the landslide. I strongly suggest bringing a mountain bike to cut down on the total mileage of walking. Even with my bike it took 10 hours (more like 9 hours without picking up beautiful rocks).Trail Condition: No snow at this point on the mountain, however there is a lot of mud on the &quot;secret&quot; road. T use the &quot;secret road&quot; and to avoid the landslide, take the faint grass/dirt road that is behind all the cut up logs when you exit the forest to a meadow (pictured below). The road is rough and covered in river rock for most of the way. Once at the trailhead, it starts out with a nice dirt path, but will turn back into rough river rock for the majority of the hike. Once in the forest, you may get lost around the creek a couple times, but you should be able to find your way back easily with the cairns. Once out of the forest, it's mostly an easy hike to follow to the summit. On the way down, I lost my way a little when entering back into the forest, but remembered my surroundings and got back on track."

                            "report" : "The forest service road 580 is closed by locked gate next to the Aspen River ranch entrance, 5.2 miles before the Lily Lake trailhead. The landslide itself is 3.0 miles beyond the gate, 2.2 mi. from the trailhead. The landslide is massive, but if you detour around to the left of it, staying low and walking maybe 0.25 mi., you can quickly return to a dirt road which merges with 580 after only another 0.5 mi. So it is the locked gate, not the landslide, which really makes the hike arduous, 19 mi. round-trip by my math. The additional problem is that you can't legally park on the road at the gate. There are several creative(!) solutions to the problem, the best legal one being to ride your mountain bike to the Lily Lake trailhead. You can easily carry the bike across 100 yds. of landslide to continue riding. So, from the last point where you can legally park on 580, before reaching private property, you will probably ride 8-10 miles up rough dirt road to the trailhead. Thus, the hike is still 8.25 mi., with the addition of a 20 mi. bike ride. The route yesterday was dry, the weather beautiful, and the elk noisy. I ascended by the stable ridge and descended the loose north face gully. No surprises on the mountain itself."

The road is a mellow grade and its scenic, I saw several deer and a heard of big horn sheep on the hike in. It takes about 3 hours with a moderate pace. The landslide is very impressive! On your way in, a ways before the actual landslide there is a meadow and a pull off with several large dead trees laid out in a line as a barrier. Follow this road through the meadow because it is the detour road! If you choose to keep pressing forward on the main road (like I did) you will end up at the edge of the landslide and be forced to cross it or backtrack a ways to the meadow. On the way in I hiked straight across it and that was a bitch with a heavy pack, up and over and under so many huge aspens. But on the way out I followed the &quot;detour&quot; road which is not a sustainable road so everybody needs to stop bitching about how the road is still closed. I hiked in on the trail after the upper TH about 1/2 mile and there's a really good campsite, before that and for the last mile on the road there are plenty of campsites but no water nearby. Did not encounter any bears but I had a bear canister and stashed it well away from my camp, and did all cooking and eating away from camp. The north face route is straightforward, gully isn't that bad and has a lot of fun scrambling opportunities if you want them. We bailed on the Ridge route due to high winds. I made a traverse over to Huerfano too, will post conditions on the 13er page.I stayed 3 days and did California from the Zapata trail at the lower TH and then Lindsey/Huerfano the next day and packed out. It was an awesome trip, basically had the entire place to myself, and SO worth it."

At this point you can either go right (much faster, but steep climb with loose gravel for about a 1/4 mile, then you enter the willows and the trail is easy enough to see, but easy to lose if you are goosenecking and looking at the scenery) At the top of this route to the right you will encounter another stick in rocks and at this point you head down to the lookers left to meet up with the Colorado Trail. The other option, to go left takes you a little while longer, but offers an easier hike with switch backs and a slower gain. Sadly there is a lot of beetle kill in the little forest in the valley. We had a great day with sun and great wild flowers due to the rain. The trail is easiest enough to follow at this point, and you can see San Luis from the valley until you climb it. This mountain reminded me of Bross.....scree, scree, scree on the way up and the summit was just a smaller version of being on Bross. Had the summit almost to myself with only 2 other people. But very glad I could cross this lump of a mountain off the list. My favorite part was that we had a super clear day, and you could see almost every other range!"

There are also plenty of trout in the ponds the beavers have created (I saw lots of them swimming, but didn't have my pole.) Of course, with lots of standing water, there are also mosquitoes in the lower elevations. I didn't get bitten, but was glad to be wearing long pants and long sleeves during the return to the TH.

Route: Once you get to the talus field, it's a steep hike. It was hard to stand upright at any point - most of the time I was having to lean into the mountain and found I made quicker progress when I had at least one hand on the ground. To compound, there is a ton of small gravel type rock so it is very hard to find good footing. Definitely stay to left side of the first gully where there are some bigger rocks to get traction on. The second gully is much easier before getting to the V-notch. Not going to lie, the notch was the my first experience with that type of move and the palms were sweating...Take your time when you get up there. The summit was very cold and it was very windy the whole time. Took me 1:40 to summit from 11,700 and 2:20 to get down since I was going sideways most of the way down.

Good, solid hand/foot holds throughout except as mentioned above. Very fun 3 class where the heart pounding came from the stunning views instead of dubious holds.Descent on scree was long and unpleasant due to so many climbers below (some coming up that way; why anyone would do that boring route up is beyond me). I would have glissaded down most sections. As it was, it was a tedious way down. If I do it again, I'll go back down the 3rd class route, down climbing sections as I go up to make sure I can do them safely. Besides, the rock climbing is so fun, that would make it worth it alone!"

The flowers are also quite pretty. Once you make it to the actual trailhead, the whole hike is talus. You walk around to the left side of Sneffels before you start heading up into the giant 500 foot scree field. Stay near big rocks to help you get up easier. You'll then run into another 500 foot gully to your left, but this one is fun! Climb up boulders and right before the top, head to the left to find the &quot;V&quot; notch. Once past that, follow the cairns to the top! Because of all the scrambling, expect it to slow your average pace."

It joins the &quot;main&quot; trail at around 13,800' where the main ridge starts for the final ascent. This ridge is beautiful, provides great views of all the neighboring peaks, and made Missouri Mountain our favorite 14er to date (up to #18 so far). The West trail is very, very steep and has lots of rocks between 13,000 and 13,800. We took this part slow in the morning because some of the rocks were slick and we took it slow coming down to take it easy on our knees. Hiking poles were helpful going up and a necessity (in my opinion) going down the steep, rocky, gravely slopes. We only passed 2 other people on the 'West' trail (passed others where the trails merge), so if you're looking for a scenic, less-populated trail and can handle the 4WD road, this is a great option!"

We opted to keep high immediately after exiting the downclimb so we could use the rocks for balance, and I think that was the right move.  Only other excitement was the large mountain goat guarding the saddle right where you drop off the ridge.  He lowered his head and walked on the trail towards us as we approached (maybe 15 ft away?), so we opted to climb up and over the rocks just before the saddle to skirt around him (one eye on him, one eye on our footing).  We alerted the folks climbing up to the ridge, and at one point we saw he had climbed down the trail, causing a few of those folks to beat a hasty retreat.

Don't miss the first junction at the base of Mt. Belford. Make sure you go right. Everyone complains how bad the scree is once you're on the mountain, but in my personal opinion, it's not that bad at all. There's a nasty part of the trail that is quite slippery on the backside of the ridge, near the summit. Make sure you have shoes with good grip, and stay close to the rocks for support."

Going up N Maroon on the south side is dry. Going down N Maroon on the north side, there is about 1-3 inches of fairly consistent snow above 13k feet. Take care going up or down.. You can avoid some of the snow by carefully stepping on rocks, but in other places it is more packed down and a bit slick. It CAN be done without traction.. We made it down without microspikes.. We made it okay, but were very slow and careful. I would recommend taking yaktrax or microspikes though. I was thinking about putting them on, but was almost past the snowy area at that time. The chimney is dry in most places, but if your shoes are wet from the snow, it is more tricky."

A black top road all the way to the trailhead! You'll know you're going the right way when you pass the beautiful garden on the side of the road!*Trail Condition: Easy to follow until you get to the first junction needed to go up to the Maroon Bells. Look for a very large cairn in the talus rocks by the stream. Head right! The trail is very steep and you'll gain a lot of elevation quickly. I didn't have too many problems with slipping on scree either. Once you're up on the ridge, the trail is well marked by cairns, but make sure you take mental notes of the area for when you're coming back. The gullies aren't nearly as scary as what it looks online. We went up the first gully, stay to the left. The easiest way up the second gully is staying all the way to the right. Past that you'll get to use your arms to pull you up and it gets fun, but know your limits. I never felt too exposed, or in danger for my life."

The route up Harvard was no issue, trail is well marked and easy to follow. Started the traverse over to Columbia around 12:30pm with the thought we would take the ridge the whole way. Got to a point in the ridge and it looked like the only way was the trail dropping off to the left. Took that down a steep and loose chute, which ended up spitting us out much below the ridge and into the gully. Decided to just take the gully and bouldered our way up to Columbia along-side the ridge. Added a few extra miles and the route was not clear, but the bouldering was pretty easy. Made it to the summit of Columbia around 3pm, stopped for a quick bite to eat and headed out on our descent. This is where things got tricky. The typical descent down Columbia is AWFUL. Steep with very loose dirt and rock the entire way down. In my opinion, worse than the descent down Bross (and I thought that was in bad shape). Really hoping REI puts in the money for trail restoration on Columbia (vote!).  Eventually made it back down to our car around 5:30pm. My fitbit read almost 20 miles by the end of the trip. I can see why many people choose to do the combo in two days."

The gully section and the remainder of the route until you gain the Columbia ridge is a shit show and very difficult to figure out (at least for me).  Very difficult route finding and difficult to interpret the pictures of this section.  Study pictures #15 and #16 closely...I avoided the main death gully, but got caught up in a second smaller one and did not completely descend the east ridge.  Cairns are few and far between at this point and the right turn @ 12,800 is also super tricky. Picking through the talus is mind numbing and finding the route is very frustrating.  The down climb of the west slopes of Columbia is a complete disaster.  This is easily the loosest runniest chauce pile I have encountered.  Probably a better idea to climb Columbia first if one were to do the traverse as others have suggested. The west slopes of Columbia is a very slippery down climb and hope REI applies the money to improve this trail (I certainly voted for it)."

We did tons of bouldering and sliding down very steep talus and loose rocks at 1 point I was very afraid I was going to get hurt and fall because the rocks are incredible loose. We were very lucky to make it to the top to Colombia and had very good weather but I am warning everyone to really consider not doing these 2 in the same day because of how dangerous the rock slides are to get over from Harvard to Colombia.We met some really nice hikers and had great company.

Little exposure. Do bring your Yak Traks if you're climbing both mountains as we ran into a lot of snow especially going to Columbia. It almost would be nice to have poles as well. There is a steep, very slippery, very long gully making your way to Columbia. Once you climb Columbia, the trail down is mostly the same: steep, slippery, very very long gully.

Beginning with Little Bear, the Hourglass actually wasn't nearly as technically challenging as I expected.  I'd say climbing never exceeded 3rd class the entire time.  There's a very small trickle of water that you can easily avoid.  Just be careful early in the morning though, as much of it was frozen solid and could be  a significant hazard if you can't avoid it all together.  Rock fall danger is definitely a threat in there as well, so be very careful if there are other climbers present.The LB-Blanca ridge was incredible and definitely the gnarliest traverse I've ever done.  The exposure and difficulties are relentless for the entire distance.  One notable feature that I feel like people should be aware of comes about halfway across the ridge.  As you approach one of the headwalls, you'll hit a gap on the ridge crest.  Although it's tempting, you should NOT try to cross directly over this gap.  It's actually quite easy to backtrack a few yards and just go down to the left around this wall.  The rock on most of the ridge, including this area, is pretty rotten and trying to jump across that gap could quickly turn into a fatal mistake.  There quite a few other spots where you have to decide whether to cross directly up and over some small towers or skirt around the ledges.  The dangers come from either traversing along the exposed face or having to downclimb the narrow and crumbly ridge each time, your choice.  Other than that, it's just a matter of staying focused and moving deliberately with each step and hand hold. Overall, it was a beautiful fall day in the Sangres.  These conditions won't last much longer, so get it while you can."

Hourglass is pretty dry, very few little tiny trickles of ice here and there. Definitely still in very good condition. There are up to 4 fixed ropes, the longest one, and the one you see first, is a blue one and is in alright condition. Later it turns into the salmon colored one that you see at the anchor. We used it only on the way down to hold onto, putting full bodyweight on it at times. There are a lot of knots to isolate abraded sheathing, and we added a few more.

Little Bear is closer in route difficulty to Snowmass than either Capitol or North Maroon in my book.- The route description says to stay to the right side of the gully that starts at 12,000 feet. We actually climbed up solid rock on the left side of the gully and this made the gully a fun, quick section. Whatever you do, avoid doing a scree slog by going right up the middle of the gully."

If you are tight on a budget like myself, park in the residential area not far from the train station for free- just be sure to look for parking signs. Train costs $100!! You can also take the train from Silverton- which I recommend. If you call them, you can get a discount- tell them you're being dropped off at Needleton either way.*Trail Condition: Needleton Stop to Chicago Basin (6 mi.): Trail is very well marked and an easy incliine. The best part of the hike is about 3 miles in (lots of waterfalls). Windom: Trail will be wet from streams in some places, but not bad at all. Look for cairns on slabs to lead the way. Once you reach Twin Lakes, it's all bouldering. Avoid taking a path that leads to the far right. Stay to the left of Windom, and travel up the valley first."

Side note: I realize this doesn't apply to 99% of the people on here, but, in case the other 1% is reading: please don't cut the switchbacks that gain the 13.8' shoulder! Not only does this contribute to slope erosion and undo the hard work put in by the CFI volunteers in maintaining the trail, but it directly exposes hikers below to completely unnecessary rockfall hazard.

If you are tight on a budget like myself, park in the residential area not far from the train station for free- just be sure to look for parking signs. Train costs $100!! You can also take the train from Silverton- which I recommend. If you call them, you can get a discount- tell them you're being dropped off at Needleton either way.*Trail Condition: Needleton Stop to Chicago Basin (6 mi.): Trail is very well marked and an easy incliine. The best part of the hike is about 3 miles in (lots of waterfalls). Sunlight: I took the very steep gully from Windom's notch. Be very careful if you do so also. Crossing the boulders to get to Sunlight can be tricky as they can be surprisingly loose despite their size. I got thrown off one- ouch. The gully sucks. Follow the cairns to the top, and do not do the final hops if you have never bouldered, are alone, or don't have ropes. I didn't do it, and my pride is still in tact."

This can make the summit a little more sketchy.  Having an axe also allows for a fun descent down to the basin in sections.   Early morning the snow is firm, and you can avoid dangerous post holes, by 1:00 PM the snow is super soft and careful snow travel to avoid post holing to your waist is needed."

Backpack in is fairly easy albeit long but strenuous with a large pack and we did encounter one heavy rain storm in the afternoon.  The climb on Sunday was a long affair.  Stay on the trail around the lake through the willows and prepare for some bush wacking as the willows have overgrown the trail (trail crew would do well here to trim back the willows). Moving onto the scree slope is not difficult however, once on the scree slope this is a very steep, loose and dangerous trail and would recommend donning a helmet for this section.  After the scree slope things loosen up a bit onto solid rock but route finding becomes tricky.  My advice would be to stick to the cairns and avoid the direct route.  Once on the ridge, the teeth of the route show themselves.  The route is well cairned and again, would advise to follow the cairns without fail.  The final section before the summit has some exposure and would recommend going left of the ridge and stay well below it if you don't like exposure.  Downclimb was also tricky and found it more difficult going down than going up in regards to route finding.  The views over to Hagerman Peak are stunning and on the summit views of Capitol are also great, but did not linger on the summit as it is a very small ish summit and you have to almost peer over to see Capitol.  Weather was overcast with clouds whipping up behind the ridge and Hagerman, was difficult to judge the weather as the Elks have their own system and it seems that Capitol and Snowmass also have their own micro climate.  Just watch it carefully.  The scree slope was extremely dangerous on the downclimb and would be worth exploring the grassy section to the right looking up the slope, but it also looks like it cliffs out in several areas.  Was mesmerized even more by Snowmass Peak the 13 er that rises up from the lake and looked up but found no information on climbing routes up this spectacular peak, seems like most of the focus is on climbing Hagerman Peak."

Gaiters are very helpful for this section. The scree slope above the lake was pure misery. There is, however, a very nice trail on the climber's right of the gully where the water streams down which avoids most of the scree misery. There was a cairn as of 8/15 to mark the entrance to that trail on the right of the gully - it starts probably 1/3 of the way up the scree slope. There are a couple of snowfields while gaining the upper ridge that can be completely avoided, OR you can use micro-spikes to work your way up those snowfields, if you've hauled them all the way up there (the snow was very supportive). All in all, not worth carrying any traction. It was an awesome day on the mountain. Be prepared for a slog - and carry plenty of water (or a filter). I needed almost 4L, starting @ 10,000 ft."

I did scrape the underside of my car a couple times, but nothing serious. It will take guts, but it can be done!*Trail Condition: Easy to follow, but muddy in some spots on trail that leads to Humboldt Peak. Since we camped at the Upper Colony Lake, we walked back down just past the Lower Colony Lake. Once we could see the much smaller lake just north, we headed down into the willows and crossed a small stream and came back up to the &quot;Crestone Needle&quot; sign. This is the MOST DIRECT way to get onto the other path that leads to the Crestones if you camp near the Lower Colony Lake and did Humboldt first. It will save you a lot of miles cutting across vs. hiking all the way back to this junction (pictured below). I have NO idea why they don't have an official connector point.Broken Hand Pass is just switchbacks and large steps until you get further up. Then you'll have to do some difficult class 2 moves to pull yourself up into the short slippery gully which brings you to the saddle. The trail get's easier here a short time until you get to the &quot;East Gully&quot;. If you take the Class 3 route MAKE SURE YOU TAKE MENTAL NOTES OR LITERAL PICTURES OF THE TERRAIN AROUND YOU. Alix and I got lost, and a man is still lost on the mountain. MAKE ANOTHER NOTE OF HOW HIGH YOU ARE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE &quot;WEST GULLY&quot;. Currently there's tape and a bandanna marking the spot. The elevation at the start of the &quot;West Gully&quot; is 13,690 feet. The gullies are overall nice and easy to go up, not too much loose rock, some class 3 moves, exposure and a helmet is recommended if going in groups."

No equipment is required if you walk inside it. You can get into it by walking ten steps across the gradual snow at the base. Avoid the main snowfield unless you have the equipment and experience.Needle: No snow at all. Solid 3rd class if you can completely follow the route. It is easy to go too far on the gully traverse and get a bit of 4th class.Peak: The red gully has a bunch of snow in various areas. There is a river flowing down the center. The climb is solid class 3 scrambling because the trail is mostly hidden by either the snow or the river. The main snow field (see picture) can be entirely bypassed on climber's left. Keep ascending on easy 3rd class ledges until you are completely above it. A fall on the snow field could easily be fatal (like on Friday).There is some snow near the top of the gully that is much more difficult to go around. The most problematic one is immediately below the saddle of East Crestone and Crestone Peak. We used ice axes on the descent. If you slip, the fall would be about 15', likely a broken ankle in the worst case. Those upper snow patches should be gone in 2-3 weeks since they are not too deep and are melting fast. In the meantime it could get tougher as it becomes icier. There likely are class 3-4 bypass routes if you search for them."
